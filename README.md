### Face2Screen-Distance-Recommender

:star:**Please star the repository if you happen to like the project**

This project was submitted to Byld+WiT Hackthon 2021

The project is basically a combination of two themes - Healthcare and I can't Learn Online.

In the project we have looked upon the problem of increased screen time during online classes which adversely affects the eyes of students.While attending the classes we tend to bring our face too close to the screen,which hampers the health of our eyes.Our project helps tackle the same.

The project uses Computer Vision to detect the face of student and continuously displays the distance of the face from the computer screen.
When the distance becomes less than 30 cm then the program tells the students to maintain distance from the screen by means of a popup.

Steps To reach a runnable demo:

Prerequisites:
1.You must have an IDE to run the python code.
2.You must have open cv installed on the IDE.
3.You must have haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml in your pc and should replace the path of cascade classifier function to the path where you have stored ha in your pc.arcascade_frontalface_default.xml in your pc.

Then just run the code in your IDE and program will start.


Add-ons:
We have also thought to include posture recognision in our project which would tell the student to sit erect if the student is not sitting in a proper posture which can be detected by ml algorithms.

We have added the example of the same in the repo.
